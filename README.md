# ðŸ”‘ Comments

* **If you want to get started, I recommend referring to the *Accepted Papers with the Released Code*, as it provides an easy way to explore research papers and their associated code implementations. 
Furthermore, building your algorithm on top of state-of-the-art algorithms will greatly enhance your productivity and efficiency.**

* If you are interested in sequential decision-making problems, it is recommended to focus primarily on **EA-Assisted Optimization of RL** and **Synergistic Optimization of EA and RL**. If you are interested in other optimization problems, it is suggested to pay attention to **RL-Assisted Optimization of EA**. I primarily focus on the former.



**If you do find our survey or the repository helpful (or if you would be so kind as to offer us some encouragement), please consider kindly giving a star, and citing our paper.**
